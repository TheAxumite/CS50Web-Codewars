n Django, the HttpRequest class is defined in the django.http module and represents an incoming HTTP request. It contains properties such as the request method (GET, POST, etc.), headers, and the body of the request. The HttpRequest class is also responsible for parsing the incoming request and making the data it contains accessible through its attributes.

On the other hand, request is just a variable name that is commonly used to refer to an instance of the HttpRequest class, which is passed as an argument to views in Django. It's a way to access the current HttpRequest in the views, middlewares or any other place in the application where the request object is accessible.

In summary, HttpRequest is a class and request is an instance of that class, which is passed to views and other functions and contains the information about the current HTTP request.

Django's http module contains several classes and functions for working with HTTP requests and responses. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

HttpRequest: Represents an incoming HTTP request. It has properties such as method, path, GET, POST, and COOKIES, as well as methods for parsing the request body, handling file uploads, and more.
HttpResponse: Represents an HTTP response. It has properties such as content, status_code, and headers, as well as methods for setting cookies, and more.
HttpResponseRedirect: A subclass of HttpResponse that indicates that the client should be redirected to a different URL. It takes a single argument, the URL to redirect to.
JsonResponse: A subclass of HttpResponse that is used to return JSON-encoded data to the client. It takes a single argument, a Python object, which will be converted to a JSON string before being sent to the client.
Http404: Exception class for a 404 error. It can be raised in a view function to indicate that the requested resource could not be found.
HttpResponseNotAllowed: A subclass of HttpResponse that indicates that the requested method is not allowed for the requested resource.
HttpResponseBadRequest: A subclass of HttpResponse that indicates that the request was invalid and could not be processed.
HttpResponseForbidden: A subclass of HttpResponse that indicates that the client is not authorized to access the requested resource.
HttpResponseServerError: A subclass of HttpResponse that indicates that an internal server error occurred while processing the request.
HttpResponseNotModified: A subclass of HttpResponse that indicates that the requested resource has not been modified since the client last requested it.
HttpResponseGone: A subclass of HttpResponse that indicates that the requested resource is no longer available and will not be available again.
HttpResponseNoContent: A subclass of HttpResponse that indicates that the server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.
HttpResponseSeeOther: A subclass of HttpResponse that indicates that the client should repeat the request to a different URI.
